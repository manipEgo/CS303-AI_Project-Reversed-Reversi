## Chessboard
`8*8` 2-dimensional array representation. Support to arbitrary size is not implemented.

## Agent
One AI playing one side is registered as one agent. Games are played between two agents.

## Agent Algorithm
Minimax Algorithm with position value, mobility, and number-of-chess weighting. Binary representation of the chessboard is introduced for better efficiency.

## Genetic Algorithm
Poorly implemented basic Genetic Algorithm. Multi-Processing supported.
