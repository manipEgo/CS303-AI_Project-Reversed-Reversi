## Play Games
Run test.py

## Run Genetic Algorithm
Run genetic_algorithm/genetic_algorithm.py

------

## Chessboard
`8*8` 2-dimensional array representation. Support to arbitrary size is not implemented.

## Agent
One AI playing one side is registered as one agent. Games are played between two agents.

## Agent Algorithm
Minimax Algorithm with position value, mobility, and number-of-chess weighting. Binary representation of the chessboard is introduced for better efficiency.

## Genetic Algorithm
Poorly implemented basic Genetic Algorithm. Multi-Processing supported.

## Docs Folder
Project introduction, Game rule introduction, and project report. ~~计系课别再惦记你那逼报告了就这点逼算法还要我按论文结构写你以为这是 OI A+B Problem 吗我也没那本事上花里胡哨的写法啊这玩意儿还占这么多分折磨学生写折磨助教读所有人受伤的世界到达了太美丽了计系不觉得这很酷吗所以项目报告什么时候似啊~~
